            <p> Steven was the second of two children. He was born in New York City and his family later moved to Yonkers, NY, where he attended Roosevelt High School. He was expelled from Roosevelt for drug use and later graduated from Jose Quintano's School for Young Professionals. Before working as a professional musician, Tyler says he worked several odd jobs, including a stint at a bakery. Music has always played a large role in Tyler's life as he was the son of a classical musician who helmed the Vic Tallarico Orchestra. His father taught music at Cardinal Spellman High School in the Bronx for many years. Steven Tyler also took a liking to blues and in the 1960s, he was a drummer and singer in a variety of local rock and roll bands including The Strangeurs/Chain Reaction, The Chain, and William Proud. Tyler spent time in the summers of his youth in the NH lakes region where he met his future band mates. He has residences in Marshfield MA and Lake Sunapee NH.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Name:</b> Thomas William Hamilton</li>
              <li><b>Born:</b> 12/31/1951 Colorado Springs, CO</li>
              <li><b>Height:</b> 6' 1"</li>

            <p>Tom began playing guitar at the age of twelve and switched to bass because the only local band needed a bassist. He co-wrote three of Aerosmith's hits, Sweet Emotion (perhaps most noted for the bass line), Janie's Got a Gun, and Jaded. He plays rhythm guitar on another song he co-wrote, Sick as a Dog and also co-wrote Uncle Salty from Toys in the Attic. He married Terry Cohen in 1975 and they have two children. Hamilton was the last member of the band to come clean of his drug addictions, having smoked marijuana up to the recording of Permanent Vacation. In August 2006, he announced that he was diagnosed with throat cancer and completed a seven-week course of radiation and chemotherapy. He was forced to miss Aerosmith's Route Of All Evil Tour. David Hull (who has played in The Joe Perry Project) filled in for Hamilton. Hamilton had never previously missed an Aerosmith show. He joined the band for the performance of Sweet Emotion at their Boston show in September 2006, and at the private show at the Beacon Theatre in New York, on December 3, 2006, where he reclaimed his place with the band for the entire performance. Tom is the tallest member of the band at 6'1". He is also the funny one of Aerosmith, always looking for chances to make jokes in interviews and also being one of the bigger talkers at interviews.</p>

            <p>It was Joey who named the band in 1973. Kramer briefly attended the Thornton Donovan School. According to the band's autobiography, Walk This Way, Kramer was frequently the one collecting money owed to the group. His first writing credit with the band was Pandora's Box on their second album, Get Your Wings. Of all the members of the band, Kramer has written the fewest songs. Kramer's son's Jesse also plays drums. He filled in for Joey in 2005 at several Aerosmith shows while Joey was recovering from strained muscles. During the formation of Aerosmith, it was Joey Kramer who suggested the name Aerosmith for the group of young musicians. Joey currently play DW drums.</p>

            <p>The paternal side of Perry's family are Portuguese, originally from Madeira. His grandfather changed the family's name from Pereira to Perry upon arriving in the United States of America. His maternal side is Italian, more specifically Neapolitan. Perry and his younger sister, Mike Tozzi, grew up in the small town of Hopedale, Massachusetts. There, his father was an accountant and his mother a high school gym teacher and later an aerobics instructor. She later retired to Arizona while Perry's father died in 1975. Perry also attended the prep school Vermont Academy, a boarding school of about 230 students in Saxtons River, Vermont.</p>

              <li><b>Born:</b> 02/23/1952 Winchester, MA</li>

            <p> After attending the Berklee College of Music, Whitford played in local bands Symbols of Resistance, Teapot Dome, and Earth, Inc., before joining Aerosmith in 1971, replacing original guitarist Ray Tabano. Aerosmith would go on to be one of the most successful bands of the 1970s. However, following a string of less successful albums in the late 1970s, Whitford left the band in 1981 to work on his own project with singer Derek St. Holmes, simply called Whitford/St. Holmes. The project was soon dissolved, following the disappointing sales of their first (and last), eponymous album. Whitford briefly toured with The Joe Perry Project, featuring former Aerosmith band mate Joe Perry, before both Perry and Whitford rejoined Aerosmith in 1984. In the mid-late 1980s all band members completed drug rehabilitation, including Whitford, who completed programs to combat his alcohol abuse. Whitford remains sober to this day and continues to be an active force in Aerosmith. Whitford also served as a producer for a well-known Boston band, The Neighborhoods, who were led by a rabid Aerosmith fan, David Minehan. When, in 1994, Whitford was forced to leave unexpectedly in the middle of an Asian tour due to family illness, Minehan was flown to Japan where he performed in Whitford's place for several days until Whitford returned.</p>
